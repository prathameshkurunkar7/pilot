# Admin UI

The Admin UI is the browser surface for benches, sites, apps, tasks, logs, and settings. It should expose operations without reimplementing backend rules.

## Layout

The Vue app lives under `admin/frontend`. Backend API routes live under `admin/backend/api/v1`.

Keep UI code organized by feature area: benches, sites, apps, tasks, logs, settings, setup, and shared utilities.

Frontend source structure:

```text
admin/frontend/src/
  api/          endpoint wrappers and API URL/error helpers
  composables/  reusable state, loading, polling, stream, and workflow logic
  components/   reusable UI pieces grouped by feature
  pages/        route-level screens that compose components and composables
  layouts/      shared page chrome
  utils/        pure formatting and browser helpers
```

Pages should stay thin. Put fetch/mutate state in composables, HTTP details in `api`, and repeated UI in components.

## Components

Use Frappe UI by default. Think carefully before writing custom controls, overlays, menus, tables, inputs, dialogs, toasts, loading states, or empty states.

Custom UI is acceptable when Frappe UI does not provide the behavior, but keep it small and reusable. Prefer wrapping Frappe UI components over rebuilding interaction and accessibility from scratch.

## Data Flow

- Fetch state from the Admin API.
- Start long operations through task endpoints.
- Subscribe to task status, steps, and logs.
- Refresh affected data after task callbacks or final task states.

The UI should treat task ids as the handle for long work.

## Settings

Settings screens edit `bench.toml` through the backend. The frontend should not know how to rewrite TOML or infer production side effects.

Post-save changes such as restarts, firewall sync, WAF sync, or S3 credential sync belong in backend/core code.

## UX Expectations

- Show the current bench and site context clearly.
- Prefer dense operational screens over marketing-style pages.
- Keep destructive actions explicit and reversible where possible.
- Show task progress and logs near the operation that started them.
- Do not hide backend errors behind generic failure messages.

## Local Work

Use the repo scripts and package metadata for exact frontend commands. After API shape changes, update the API client and run the relevant frontend checks.
